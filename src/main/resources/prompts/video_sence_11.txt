Imagine you're building an arch out of wedge-shaped stones (called **voussoirs**).

1.  **Building Upwards:** You start building from both sides, placing the voussoirs on temporary supports (called **centering**). Each stone leans slightly inwards towards the center of the arch. Gravity wants to pull these stones straight down.

2.  **The Gap at the Top:** As you build up from both sides, you're left with a gap right at the very top center of the arch.

3.  **Enter the Keystone:** This final gap is filled by a specially shaped stone, usually wider at the top and tapering downwards â€“ the **keystone**. It's often the last stone placed.

4.  **The "Locking" Action:** When the keystone is tapped into place, it wedges itself tightly between the voussoirs on either side. This does several crucial things:
    *   **Receives Force:** Gravity pulls down on the keystone itself. More importantly, the voussoirs on either side are pushing inwards and downwards *onto* the sides of the keystone due to their own weight and the weight above them.
    *   **Redirects Force:** Because of its wedge shape, the keystone takes these inward and downward forces and redirects them *outwards and downwards* into the voussoirs sitting directly below it on each side.
    *   **Creates Compression:** This action locks all the stones together. The keystone pushes outwards onto the adjacent stones, which push onto the next ones, and so on. This creates a continuous line of **compression** running through the entire arch.

5.  **Compression is Key:** Stone is very strong under compression (being squeezed) but relatively weak under tension (being pulled apart). An arch, thanks to the keystone locking it together, cleverly transforms the downward pull of gravity into compressive forces that run along the curve of the arch.

6.  **Transfer to Foundations:** These compressive forces travel down through the voussoirs on both sides until they reach the ground or the supporting columns (**abutments**). The abutments must be strong enough to handle not just the downward weight but also the outward push (thrust) generated by the arch.

**In Simple Terms:**

Think of it like leaning two stacks of books against each other. They'll fall inwards unless you put something at the very top to hold them apart. The keystone is that "something" for an arch. It sits at the apex, gets squeezed by the stones on either side, and uses its shape to push back, locking the entire structure together and directing the weight safely down to the ground through compression.

Without the keystone, the arch stones would simply fall inwards. It's the critical piece that completes the structure and allows it to stand strong by keeping everything tightly squeezed together.
