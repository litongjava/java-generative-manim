here is the detailed visual scene prompt based on your request, translated into English and formatted for Manim animation code generation.

## How to Find the Tangent Line Equation for the Function \( f(x) = x^2 \)

### 【Scene 1: Welcome Introduction & Starry Background】

-   **Background Design & Overall Atmosphere**
    -   The background consists of a deep blue rectangle covering the entire screen. Randomly distributed small white dots form a starry sky effect. These stars should exhibit subtle twinkling, achieved through sine wave variations in brightness or size, creating a mysterious and high-tech visual atmosphere.
    -   Display the scene number "01" in the top-right corner.

-   **Main Content**
    -   At the top of the screen, display the main title: "Hello everyone, welcome to this math explanation video". The text color should be pure white, appearing with a FadeIn animation effect.
    -   Below the main title, the subtitle appears sequentially in three parts:
        -   Text: "How to find the"
        -   Mathematical formula: \(f(x)=x^2\) (rendered using LaTeX)
        -   Text: "tangent line equation for"
    -   The subtitle components should appear using Write or ReplacementTransform animations, with short delays between each part to ensure the audience can follow along.

-   **Camera & Transition Effects**
    -   After the title and subtitle appear, the camera performs a slight zoom-in (moves outwards by approximately 0.2 units) to create a sense of visual guidance.
    -   The overall animation pace should be relatively smooth, with short pauses between the appearance of different elements, allowing the starry background and text effects to complement each other.

### 【Scene 2: Tangent Concept & Problem Background Introduction】

-   **Background & Layout**
    -   The background changes to a solid, light gray fill to make the main content stand out more clearly.
    -   Display the scene number "02" in the top-right corner.

-   **Content Presentation**
    -   In the left area, display detailed text explanation: "A tangent line represents the instantaneous direction of a curve at a point. For the function \(f(x)=x^2\), the tangent line reflects the slope change of the curve at that point." (Use LaTeX for the formula within the text).
    -   In the right area, construct a 2D coordinate system. Specify appropriate x-axis and y-axis ranges (e.g., x from -3 to 3, y from 0 to 9). Plot the parabola graph of the function \(f(x)=x^2\).
    -   On the parabola, select and mark the tangent point \((a, a^2)\). For visualization purposes in the code, use a specific value like \(a=1\), resulting in the point (1,1). Mark this point with a distinct red dot. Add a subtle dynamic scaling effect to the dot (pulsating based on a sine wave) to draw attention.

-   **Animation & Camera Movement**
    -   The coordinate axes and the parabola should appear using the Create animation effect. The text explanation on the left should appear sequentially, perhaps line by line, using the FadeIn effect.
    -   The camera should remain steady throughout this scene, focusing on the side-by-side presentation of the mathematical graph and the textual information.

---

### 【Scene 3: Tangent Solution Steps Demonstration】

-   **Background & Partition Design**
    -   Continue using the light gray background. Optionally, add a subtle auxiliary grid (lightly visible lines) to aid mathematical understanding.
    -   Divide the screen visually into two main parts: the left side dedicated to showing the mathematical derivation steps, and the right side displaying the corresponding graphical illustration.
    -   Display the scene number "03" in the top-right corner.

-   **Derivation Steps Content (Left Side)**
    -   **Step 1:** Identify the tangent point: \((a, a^2)\)
    -   **Step 2:** Calculate the derivative and find the slope at the tangent point: \(f'(x)=2x,\quad f'(a)=2a\)
    -   **Step 3:** Write the initial tangent line expression (point-slope form): \(y - a^2 = 2a(x - a)\)
    -   **Step 4:** Simplify to get the final tangent line equation: \(y = 2a(x - a) + a^2\)
    -   Each step, including the text labels ("Step 1:", etc.) and the formulas, should be presented clearly. All mathematical formulas must be rendered using LaTeX for clarity and correctness.

-   **Graphical Illustration (Right Side)**
    -   Draw a coordinate system similar to Scene 2. Redraw the parabola \(f(x)=x^2\).
    -   Mark the tangent point \((a, a^2)\) (again, perhaps using \(a=1\) visually, so point (1,1)) with the red dot.
    -   Calculate and draw the tangent line at this point. The line should have the slope \(2a\) (which is 2 if \(a=1\)). Draw this line in a distinct color, like orange. Ensure the line extends sufficiently beyond the point of tangency to clearly show its relationship to the curve.

-   **Animation Effects & Camera Adjustment**
    -   The mathematical formulas on the left should appear sequentially, using Write or ReplacementTransform animations for each step. Include short pauses between steps.
    -   Simultaneously or slightly delayed, the graphical elements on the right (parabola, point, tangent line) should appear using the Create effect.
    -   The camera might need slight panning or zooming during the presentation to ensure both the current derivation step on the left and the corresponding graphical element on the right are clearly visible and in focus.

---

### 【Scene 4: Theoretical Principles & Mathematical Formula Analysis】

-   **Background & Visual Partitioning**
    -   Change the background to a light gray, possibly incorporating a subtle geometric pattern or texture to emphasize mathematical rigor.
    -   Structure the screen to display different key formulas, for example, in the upper and lower halves. Optionally, use the right side for simple arrows or diagrams connecting the concepts represented by the formulas.
    -   Display the scene number "04" in the top-right corner.

-   **Main Mathematical Content**
    -   In the upper part of the screen, display the limit definition of the derivative:
        \[
        f'(x)=\lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
        \]
    -   In the lower part of the screen, display the point-slope form of a linear equation:
        \[
        y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)
        \]
    -   Visually connect these two formulas with a prominent arrow (e.g., drawn with `Arrow` mobject), illustrating the conceptual link from the theoretical definition of the slope (derivative) to its application in finding the line equation.

-   **Animation & Camera Details**
    -   Both formulas should appear sequentially using the FadeIn animation effect. Key components within the formulas (like \(f'(x)\), \(m\), \(\lim_{h \to 0}\), etc.) could be briefly highlighted using a different color (e.g., yellow or orange).
    -   At the beginning of the scene, the camera could perform a brief rotation (e.g., around the Z-axis by ~10 degrees) before settling or smoothly moving to frame the formulas, concentrating the visual focus on the theoretical underpinnings.

---

### 【Scene 5: Summary & Review】

-   **Background & Layout**
    -   Revert the background to a deep blue or black. Add a soft gradient or a subtle halo/glow effect (e.g., using `BackgroundGradient`) to create a concluding and slightly more formal atmosphere.
    -   Display the scene number "05" in the top-right corner.

-   **Review Content**
    -   Display the word "Summary" prominently at the top of the screen, perhaps in a larger font size and a distinct color like gold to signify importance.
    -   Sequentially list the three core results/formulas discussed:
        -   Tangent Point: \((a, a^2)\)
        -   Derivative (Slope): \(f'(x)=2x\)
        -   Tangent Line Equation: \(y=2a(x-a)+a^2\)
    -   At the bottom of the screen, display a thought-provoking question to engage the audience: "What other types of problems do you think the tangent line equation can help solve?"

-   **Animation & Camera Effects**
    -   The "Summary" text and the core formulas should appear one by one using FadeIn or Write animations.
    -   In the final moments of the scene, the camera could perform a slight zoom-in (e.g., increasing the scale factor to 1.1) or a gentle upward pan, focusing attention on the reviewed core content.
    -   Maintain the smooth transition style consistent with the previous scenes to ensure a natural flow leading to the end of the segment.

---

### 【Other Overall Requirements】

-   **Consistent Visual Style**
    -   All scenes should be rendered in high definition. All mathematical formulas must be presented using LaTeX format to ensure maximum clarity and professional appearance.
    -   Primarily use a cool color palette (blues, grays, white) for backgrounds and standard elements. Use contrasting, warmer colors (red, orange, gold) for key highlights, annotations (like the tangent point or line), scene numbers, and summary titles.

-   **Animation & Transitions**
    -   It's recommended to include a brief buffer time (around 0.5 to 1 second) between scenes using simple transitions like FadeOut/FadeIn or just a pause, ensuring smooth and natural scene changes.
    -   The timing of camera movements (panning, zooming, rotation) must be carefully choreographed with the appearance animations (Create, Write, FadeIn, ReplacementTransform) of text and graphical elements. The goal is to guide the viewer's focus effectively and ensure every important detail is noticed at the appropriate time.
